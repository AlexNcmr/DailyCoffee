This is the repo for my personal page.

The repo is named after my app "DailyCoffee" which is in the top directory.

DailyCoffee is an app written using Django

It asks the user for their: 
  Kindle Email (which can be found on the amazon support website)
  Personal Email
  Content preference: Hacker News, or a subreddit. 
  
The script then uses amazon's ability to send docs to your kindle via email attachment to put the top 10 links in your kindle

DailyCoffee/scripts holds the python3 scripts which actually do the web scraping to get the links.

Thanks for checking out my app!
